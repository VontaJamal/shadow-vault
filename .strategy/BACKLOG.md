# Sovereign — Backlog

Items that aren't urgent but need to happen eventually.

## 🏴‍☠️ Sovereign Crest & Logo — DIRECTION LOCKED

**Priority:** Medium-High (blocks merch, flag, anime branding, website identity, emoji)

### The Vision

**The Sovereign Crest:** A stylized pharaoh face with Ra & Set (twin daggers) crossed behind it — coat of arms style. The pharaoh's eyes are the **Rinshari** — the all-seeing eye. Sauron energy. A burning, never-blinking gaze that watches everything in the Nexus. Mordor energy for anyone on the outside looking in.

### Three Asset Tiers

1. **True Logo (Full Crest)**
   - Pharaoh face, Ra & Set crossed behind, Rinshari eyes blazing through the mask
   - Sauron-level presence — the eye ignites, the screen feels it
   - Rinshari evolves: base → awakened → final (different contexts/tiers)
   - Used on: website header, anime throne room, merch, splash screens, podcast backdrop

2. **Sovereign Mode Variant**
   - Same pharaoh, but Ra & Set have merged into **Eclipse** (single katana) behind the head
   - The "transformation" version — represents full Sovereign activation
   - Used on: Sovereign mode toggle, special branding moments, anime transformation scenes

3. **Simplified Mark (Emoji/Favicon)**
   - Pharaoh silhouette + crossed daggers only — no eye detail
   - Must read clean at 16x16 pixels
   - Monochrome variant for dark/light backgrounds
   - Used on: custom emoji, favicon, GitHub badges, small format branding

### Brand Colors (Apply to Crest)
- Crimson Red (#CC0000) — Rinshari eye glow, primary accent
- Obsidian Black (#0A0A0F) — pharaoh mask, background
- Ember (#FF4500) — eye ignition state, fire accents
- Bone (#E8E4DE) — dagger detail, outline work
- Gunmetal (#2C3539) — structural elements
- Purple is fair game for merch, anime, clothing — just banned from the djws.io website specifically

### Deliverables from Artist
- All 3 tiers as vector files (SVG + AI)
- Color and monochrome versions
- Transparent backgrounds
- Animation-ready layers (separate: face, daggers/Eclipse, eyes)
- Style: dark fantasy / anime aesthetic — NOT corporate, NOT minimalist tech

### Animation (Phase 2 — After Static Logo Locked)
- 3-5 second logo sting: daggers slide together → Eclipse forms → Rinshari ignites
- For: podcast intro, YouTube bumper, website Sovereign toggle
- Tools: After Effects, Cavalry, or Live2D
- Fiverr logo animation specialists: $50-150 range

### Where to Commission

**Fiverr (recommended start):**
- Search: "dark fantasy logo" or "anime crest design" or "custom coat of arms"
- Top sellers to look for: artists who do fantasy emblems, gaming clan logos, anime-style crests
- Budget: $100-300 for full vector crest package (3 tiers)
- Link: https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=dark+fantasy+logo+design

**Alternatives:**
- **ArtStation** (https://www.artstation.com) — higher-end concept artists, portfolio browsing, $200-500 range
- **Etsy** — custom coat of arms designers, some do anime-style
- **r/HungryArtists** (Reddit) — post the brief, artists come to you
- **99designs** (https://99designs.com) — contest format, multiple artists submit, you pick winner (~$300-500)

**Best move:** Fiverr first. Find 2-3 artists whose existing dark fantasy / anime emblem work matches the energy, send the brief, compare sketches. Can bundle with the character design commission to get consistent visual language.

### Clothing Line — Sovereign Apparel

**Lead:** Neisha (Coya / @StylezbyCoyaa) — fashion design, garment design, aesthetic direction
**Support:** Indra — brand vision, business, what looks good

Neisha is a stylist and already into designing clothes. She runs the fashion side. Indra provides the crest, lore, brand guidelines, and business structure. This is a real collab, not merch-on-demand.

**When to start:** After the crest is finalized and character designs are locked. The logo needs to exist before it goes on fabric.
