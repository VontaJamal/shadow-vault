# Shadow Dominion — Content Plan

The world must know. Every platform. Every format. Every repo.

---

## The Message

You built an ecosystem of open-source tools that actually work because you use them every day. They're free. They're themed. They're documented. The only barrier to entry is being willing to figure it out — and you've already made that as easy as possible.

The Shadow Dominion isn't a portfolio. It's production infrastructure you're letting people borrow.

## Platform Strategy

| Platform | Audience | Format | Frequency | Tone |
|----------|----------|--------|-----------|------|
| **TikTok** | Developers 18-30, anime fans who code | 15-60s shorts, screen recordings with avatar overlay | 5-7/week | Bold, fast, "if you know, you know" |
| **YouTube Shorts** | Same as TikTok, cross-post | Same clips, vertical | 5-7/week (same content) | Same |
| **YouTube Long-form** | Senior devs, AI builders, system thinkers | 5-15 min deep dives, architecture breakdowns | 1-2/week | Confident teacher, "here's how I built this" |
| **Twitter/X** | Dev community, AI/agent builders, anime devs | Threads, screenshots, one-liners, repo drops | Daily | Punchy, declarative, lore-heavy |
| **LinkedIn** | Tech professionals, hiring managers, founders | Polished versions of Twitter threads | 2-3/week | Professional but still has personality |
| **Instagram Stories** | Casual followers, crossover anime fans | Behind-the-scenes, terminal screenshots, avatar clips | 3-5/week | Casual, visual, quick |

## Recurring Series Ideas

### "Shadow Drop" (Weekly)
Every week, drop one new tool/feature with a short + thread. The audience learns to expect it.

### "Gate Check" (Bi-weekly)
Show Shadow Gate stats — streaks, XP, rank. Public accountability.

### "Court Report" (Monthly)
What the agents did this month. Code shipped, tools built, decisions made. The AI army's monthly review.

### "Lore Drop" (Whenever)
Explain one naming choice. Why Ramuh? Why Zantetsuken? What's a Bingo Book? The FF/anime fans will LOVE these.

## Production Notes

- All shorts: captions/text overlay mandatory (most watch muted)
- Terminal recordings: clean dark theme, large font, OBS or Screen Studio
- Avatar overlay: the Akatsuki/Shadow Monarch animation on screen during narration
- Voice: real voice preferred for authenticity, AI voice clone for batch production
- Every video ends with: **"Execute. ⚔️"**
- Never explain anime references. If they don't know, they'll look it up. That's the hook.
- No trading or crypto content on public channels. That stays internal.
- Don't soften the personality for any platform. LinkedIn gets the same energy, just slightly more structured.
