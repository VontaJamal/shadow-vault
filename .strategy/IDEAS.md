## 📝 NOTES

- All shorts should have captions/text overlay — most people watch muted
- Terminal recordings: use a clean theme, large font, dark background
- Show the personality — FF names, Solo Leveling references, the lore IS the brand
- Trading content: paper trading only, never show real positions or alpha
- Every video ends with: **"Execute. ⚔️"**
