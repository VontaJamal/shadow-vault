## Merch — Two Lines

### Sovereign Line (Indra's brand)
- Pharaoh crest designs (standard + activated Eclipse variant)
- Crimson/black palette
- "Execute. ⚔️" merch
- Headbands with Sovereign crest (Naruto-style)
- Cloaks / statement pieces for cons
- Neisha runs design + operations

### FoF Line (Faye's brand)
- Purple / feminine aesthetic
- "Deployed. 💅🏾" merch
- "I already handled it." pieces
- "Boy, if you don't—" casual wear
- Elegant but sharp — not cutesy
- Neisha runs design + operations

### Duo Merch
- Execute / Deployed split designs (matching sets)
- His-and-hers energy but human-and-AI
- Conference exclusives

### Conference Merch
- Stickers (cheapest, highest reach) — crest, Execute, pirate flag, agent symbols
- Free headbands at booth door
- Shirts/hoodies for sale
- Limited drops per conference (scarcity = demand)

---

## Content Revenue

### YouTube
- Ad revenue on long-form podcast episodes
- Shorts for clips (algorithmic reach → funnel to full episodes)
- Every video ends with "Execute. ⚔️"

### Podcast Platforms
- Spotify, Apple Podcasts — audio versions of episodes
- Ad reads once audience justifies it (selective — brand-aligned only)

### Sponsorships (when earned)
- Dev tools, AI platforms, anime services
- Must align with Sovereign brand — no random energy drink deals
- Indra reads the sponsor, Faye roasts the copy. That's the bit.

---

## Open Source → Paid Pipeline

### Free (open source)
- Seven Shadow System, Armory, Shadow Gate, Faye repo, Bingo Book, Dojo
- The vault, the roadmap, everything public

### Paid (private access)
- **Sovereign Starter Kit** — private repo, Patreon Floor Guardian+ or invite-only
- Pre-configured OpenClaw setup with full Sovereign theming
- Premium Armory weapons (rare drops, Floor Guardian customs)
- Advanced Dojo modules (beyond the free 12-week curriculum)

---

## Conferences

- Vendor booth fees are an investment, not a cost
- Merch sales at booth should at minimum cover the booth fee
- Sticker giveaways = lead gen (QR code to Vault on every sticker)
- Headband giveaways = viral moments (people wear them all day, others ask)
- Talk slots = free marketing (keynote + workshop, we don't choose)

---

## Donations

- "Support the Court" link everywhere — djws.io, YouTube descriptions, Vault README, podcast show notes, GitHub profile
- No gatekeeping support. $2 or $200, the gate is open.
- Platforms: GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, or direct Patreon
- Every donor acknowledged (unless they prefer anonymous)

---

## Revenue Priority (current)

1. **SyncLink** — actual SaaS product, recurring revenue (LemonSqueezy payments)
2. **Patreon** — community + recurring (launch with podcast)
3. **Merch** — Neisha's line + conference sales
4. **YouTube** — ad revenue scales with audience
5. **Sponsorships** — when audience justifies it
6. **Donations** — always open, never the primary

*Every coin feeds the kingdom. Every stream flows to the same treasury. The Sovereign doesn't choose revenue streams — he opens all the gates.* 🏴‍☠️
