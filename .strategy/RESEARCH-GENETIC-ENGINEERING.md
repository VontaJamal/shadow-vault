# Genetic Engineering Research — Podcast Fuel

## Episode Target: "CRISPR and Consequences" (S1E4)

### Recent Breakthroughs (Jan-Feb 2026)

**1. Gene Activation Without Cutting DNA (UNSW, Jan 2026)**
- CRISPR can now turn genes ON without cutting the DNA strand
- Massive safety improvement — no permanent edits, just activation
- Source: ScienceDaily, Jan 5 2026
- Podcast angle: "What if you could turn genes on and off like a light switch?"

**2. Reversing Antibiotic Resistance (UC San Diego, Feb 17 2026)**
- CRISPR tool that strips drug resistance from superbugs
- Projected 10M+ deaths/year by 2050 from resistant bacteria
- This could literally save millions of lives
- Podcast angle: "CRISPR vs the superbug apocalypse"

**3. Unlocking Immune Cells vs Solid Tumors (UCLA, Feb 18 2026)**
- Deleting FLI1 gene enhances killer cell survival inside tumors
- Mouse study — human trials likely coming
- Podcast angle: "What if cancer's biggest defense was one gene we could delete?"

**4. Casgevy Adoption Expanding (CRISPR Therapeutics)**
- First FDA-approved CRISPR therapy for sickle cell disease
- Broader reimbursement, more patients starting treatment
- Podcast angle: "CRISPR isn't future tech anymore. It's in hospitals right now."

### Episode Structure Ideas
- Faye draws FMA parallels (equivalent exchange, human transmutation taboo)
- Where's the line? Designer babies, enhancement vs therapy
- The accessibility problem: who gets CRISPR? Rich countries only?
- Indra's take: if you could edit your own genome, would you? What would you change?
