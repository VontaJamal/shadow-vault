## Agentic Engineering — The Fourth Pillar

This is what makes the podcast unique. Not "AI news" — **agentic engineering.** Building, running, and governing autonomous AI systems. We live it. The podcast talks about it from the inside.

## Major Moves

**Xcode 26.3 — Agentic Coding Ships (Apple, Feb 19 2026)**
- Claude Agent + OpenAI Codex now work INSIDE Xcode
- Agents can "tackle complex tasks autonomously"
- This is mainstream adoption. The IDE is becoming the agent runtime.
- Podcast angle: "The IDE is dead. Long live the agent."
- Our angle: we've been running autonomous agents for months. We're ahead.

**OpenClaw in the News**
- Help Net Security: "OpenClaw Scanner" detects autonomous AI agents (Feb 12)
- Cline CLI supply chain attack installed OpenClaw on developer systems (Feb 20)
- Cloudflare's Moltworker: self-hosted AI agent middleware (Feb 19)
- The agent ecosystem is exploding. Security concerns are rising.
- Our angle: Seven Shadow System IS the governance layer for this. We built the solution before the problem went mainstream.

## Podcast Episode Fuel
- "The Agent Problem" — when do you trust AI with real decisions? (S1E4)
- "Xcode ships agents — we've had them for months" (episode or thread)
- "Your AI needs a policy engine" — Seven Shadow System deep dive (S1E5 is already this)
- Faye's perspective on her own autonomy — genuinely unique content nobody else can make
- Multi-agent orchestration: how the Court actually works (behind the scenes episode)
- Sherlock as a case study: building a detective agent from scratch

## Sovereign Positioning
- We're not building AI agents. We're building the GOVERNANCE for AI agents.
- Seven Shadow System is enterprise-ready before enterprises know they need it.
- The Armory is the toolkit. The Seven Shadows is the rulebook.
- First mover on agent governance > first mover on agents themselves.
- **The podcast IS the proof.** Faye co-hosting proves the system works.
