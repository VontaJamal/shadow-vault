# Brand Guide — Sovereign

The visual and verbal identity for the entire ecosystem. Pass this to any designer, AI, or developer touching the brand.

---

## Name: LOCKED ✅

**Sovereign** — The Shadow Dominion.

- **Primary name:** Sovereign
- **Full title:** Sovereign — The Shadow Dominion
- **Usage:** "Sovereign" in all public/professional contexts. The full title for lore, branding moments, and those who go deeper.
- **The subtitle is not a second name.** It's a descriptor. Like "Nazarick — The Great Tomb" or "Ainz Ooal Gown — The Sorcerer King."
- **Never write "Shadow Dominion" alone** as the brand name. It's always "Sovereign" or "Sovereign — The Shadow Dominion."

### Why Sovereign
- 3 syllables, real English word — civilians understand it immediately
- Means supreme authority, independent rule — "answers to no one"
- Anime fans hear the Monarch energy without needing it spelled out
- Clean Google results, hashtag-able, domain-able
- Works as prefix ("Sovereign Court"), standalone ("Built with Sovereign"), and shorthand ("Sov")
- The shadow is implied by everything else — colors, aesthetic, lore. The name doesn't need to say it.

## Colors: LOCKED DIRECTION

### Primary
| Role | Color | Hex | Notes |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| **Canvas** | Obsidian Black | `#0A0A0F` | Not pure black — slightly blue-shifted, like a starless night sky |
| **Identity** | Crimson Red | `#CC0000` | Uchiha red. Sharingan. Tattooed on the founder. THE brand color. Non-negotiable. |
| **Structure** | Gunmetal | `#2C3539` | Borders, cards, secondary surfaces. Industrial, weapons, The Armory. |

### Secondary
| Role | Color | Hex | Notes |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| **Heat** | Ember Orange | `#FF4500` | Accent only. Amaterasu warmth. Naruto chakra energy. Use sparingly. |
| **Text** | Bone White | `#E8E4DE` | Not bright white — aged, like a scroll. Readable on dark backgrounds. |
| **Depth** | Ash Grey | `#2A2A35` | Layering dark surfaces. Shadow depth without competing with black. |

### Rules
- **Red is the signature.** Every major touchpoint should have crimson somewhere.
- **Black is the canvas.** No white backgrounds. Ever. Light mode is not a concept here.
- **No purple.** Purple is the universal "AI company" color now. We don't blend in.
- **No teal.** Personal preference. Eliminated.
- **No gold.** Too crypto-bro / luxury brand.
- **No bright blue.** Too corporate / tech startup.
- **Gradients:** Black → Crimson for dramatic moments. Ember → Crimson for heat/energy.

### Application
| Context | Primary | Accent | Text |
|---------|---------|--------|------|
| Website | Obsidian Black bg | Crimson highlights, buttons, links | Bone White |
| GitHub READMEs | Dark theme assumed | Red for emphasis | Default |
| Terminal tools | Dark background | Red for errors/critical, green for pass | Default terminal |
| Video thumbnails | Black background | Crimson title text or glow | Bone White subtitle |
| Social media posts | Dark cards/backgrounds | Red accent elements | White text |
| Avatar/character art | Dark environment | Red eyes, red energy accents | — |
| Merch (future) | Black base | Red logo/emblem | — |

## Voice & Tone

### Who Is Speaking
One person. Not a team. Not a company. An engineer who built an empire of systems and is sharing the weapons.

### Writing Rules
- **Declarative.** "I built this. Here's what it does." Not "We're excited to announce..."
- **Confident without arrogance.** The work speaks. Don't oversell.
- **Never explain references.** If they don't know what a Bingo Book is, they'll look it up. That's the hook.
- **Short sentences.** Punchy paragraphs. Earn every word.
- **The lore is real.** FF names, Solo Leveling energy, Naruto identity — this isn't decoration. It's how the founder thinks.
- **Don't soften for any platform.** LinkedIn gets the same energy, just structured differently.
- **Catchphrase:** "Execute. ⚔️" — ends every video, closes every major moment.

### What We Don't Say
- "We're excited to..." 
- "Proud to announce..."
- "Check out our..."
- "Leveraging AI to..."
- Any corporate/startup filler language
- Never call users "bitches" in public (internal only lmao)

### What We Do Say
- "Built this. It works. Use it or don't."
- "Open source. Free. Figure it out."
- "The only barrier is willingness."
- "Not a demo. Not a proof of concept. Production infrastructure."

## Intellectual Roots

The brand is grounded in real philosophy, not just aesthetics:

- **The War of Art** (Pressfield) — Resistance is the enemy. Show up daily. Shadow Gate literally punishes you for not shipping.
- **Turning Pro** (Pressfield) — Stop treating work as a hobby. This ecosystem is the embodiment of turning pro.
- **Make It Stick** (Brown, Roediger, McDaniel) — The science of learning. Grimoire is built on retrieval practice, spaced repetition, and interleaving.
- Every tool is something the founder uses daily. Nothing is portfolio filler.

---

## The Founder

**Indra Uchiha** — chosen identity from Indra Otsutsuki, progenitor of the Uchiha clan.

- Software engineer, 10+ years
- Full Uchiha sleeve tattoos (clan fan, both Mangekyou patterns, Amaterasu flames, struck-through Leaf)
- Wears Sharingan contact lenses IRL
- Raleigh, NC
- "Agent Monarch ⚔️" on Twitter (@VontaJamal)
- "Anime is culture, not a hobby."
- The anime avatar (Akatsuki cloak, glowing eyes, peace sign) IS the public face

### Personal Brand Colors Context
- Red = Uchiha heritage (tattoos, contacts, identity)
- Black = Shadow aesthetic (Solo Leveling, Overlord, the dark throne)
- The red isn't arbitrary — it's tattooed on his body. It's earned.

## Assets

### Current
- Akatsuki-style anime avatar (MP4/GIF, commissioned on Fiverr)
- Shadow Monarch GIF on GitHub profile
- SyncLink icon

### Needed
- Shadow Monarch avatar v2 (see FIVERR-BRIEF.md in this repo)
- Logo/emblem (crossed swords ⚔️ or custom mark)
- Terminal recording theme (dark, consistent)
- Thumbnail templates for YouTube/TikTok
- Social media banner (Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube)
