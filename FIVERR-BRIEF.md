# Fiverr Commission Brief — Shadow Monarch Avatar v2

**Reference:** Existing Akatsuki animation (attach the original MP4)

---

## Character Description

- Dark-skinned male, close-shaved buzzcut, lined-up facial hair (goatee)
- Athletic/lean build
- Confident, commanding presence — "I already won" energy, not aggressive

## Outfit — Shadow Monarch

- Long dark coat/cloak, black with subtle purple-black energy wisps rising from the edges (Solo Leveling shadow aura style)
- High collar, open front showing dark fitted clothing underneath
- NO Akatsuki clouds — this is his OWN kingdom, not someone else's organization
- Optional: subtle armored shoulder pieces or a chest emblem (crossed swords mark)

## Eyes

- Glowing deep violet/purple with a Sharingan-inspired pattern (3 tomoe or Eternal Mangekyou style)
- The glow should feel like controlled power, not rage

## Background

- Dark throne room or void space with purple/black shadow energy swirling
- A faint massive gate forming behind him (Solo Leveling portal aesthetic — swirling energy, not fully open)
- Moonlight optional but the shadows are the star

## Animation Sequence (3-5 seconds, loopable)

1. Standing still, shadows wisping off the coat, eyes glowing
2. Slight smirk or head tilt
3. Raises one hand — shadows gather in palm
4. Closes fist — shadows burst outward
5. Optional: peace sign ending (callback to the original)

## Art Style

Naruto Shippuden / Solo Leveling hybrid. High detail on the eyes and shadow effects. Dark color palette — black, deep purple, hints of silver.

## Deliverables

- Transparent background version (for overlays on videos/GitHub)
- Dark background version (for profile/social media)
- Looping GIF + MP4
- Still frame PNG of the best pose

## Vibe Reference

Sung Jin-Woo shadow army summoning scene meets Sasuke Susanoo activation. Regal, not chaotic. This is a king, not a berserker.
