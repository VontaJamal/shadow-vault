# Content Vault 🌀

Private content planning for the Shadow Dominion ecosystem.

Video ideas, scripts, shorts concepts, long-form outlines. Everything lives here until it ships.

## Structure

- `IDEAS.md` — Raw content ideas, organized by project
- `SCRIPTS/` — Written scripts ready for recording (future)
- `PUBLISHED.md` — Links to everything that's live (future)

## Content Philosophy

- **Shorts (< 60s):** Hook in 3 seconds. One concept. One punchline. The masses get 35 seconds max.
- **Long-form (5-15 min):** For the intellectuals. Deep dives, full walkthroughs, architecture breakdowns.
- **Every repo gets coverage.** No orphan projects.
