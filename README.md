# Shadow Vault

Private content operations for **Sovereign** — The Shadow Dominion.

Every repo in the ecosystem has a content folder here. Every piece of content — shorts, long-form, threads, posts — gets planned, drafted, and tracked before it ships.

## Content Philosophy

- **Shorts (< 60s):** Hook in 3 seconds. One concept. One demo. The masses get 35 seconds.
- **Long-form (5-15 min):** Architecture breakdowns, full walkthroughs, the "why" behind every decision.
- **Twitter/LinkedIn:** Threads, repo drops, one-liners. Same energy on every platform.
- **Every repo gets coverage.** No orphan projects.
- **Every video ends with:** "Execute. ⚔️"

## Platforms

TikTok · YouTube Shorts · YouTube Long-form · Twitter/X · LinkedIn · Instagram Stories

## The Rule

Content is a byproduct of the work, not the other way around. Every feature shipped is another short. Every tool built is another thread. The vault fills itself — you just have to hit record.
