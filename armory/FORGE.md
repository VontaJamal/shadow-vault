# The Forge 🔥

**Where Armory tools are shaped before they ship.**

The Forge is the incubation space for concepts that may graduate into the Armory. Ideas stay here until they are validated through real usage and clear user value.

## Focus Areas

- **Weapons**: Direct CLI tools for daily engineering work
- **Spells**: Scheduled automations and recurring maintenance workflows
- **Summons**: Heavy operations and orchestration-level commands
- **Items**: Playbooks and operational guidance

Current emphasis is on improving automation coverage and operator guidance.

## Concepts in the Forge

*Updated from active development patterns and feedback.*

### Under Consideration

**⚔️ Weapon — Mega Phoenix**
*"What Phoenix Down does for one machine, Mega Phoenix does at ecosystem scale."*

A full account-level backup workflow for Git hosting data. It focuses on resilient mirroring, restorable history, and clear failure reporting so teams can recover quickly when upstream services are unavailable.

**Why it surfaced:** Repeated need for platform-independent backup ownership across multiple repositories.
**Shop:** Weapons
**Priority:** High

**🐉 Seven Shadow System Feature — Sentinel Eye**
*"Give agents actionable PR intelligence, not just pass/fail outcomes."*

Agent-friendly PR monitoring integrated into Seven Shadow System. Primary capabilities:

1. **Unresolved PR comments** in structured format with `file:line` references.
2. **Failing CI log extraction** focused on actionable error regions.
3. **Lint/test issue extraction** into machine-usable output.

**Why it surfaced:** Growing demand for governance systems that also provide repair guidance.
**Shop:** Seven Shadow System feature
**Priority:** High

**📜 Spell — Glamour**
*"Polish text for natural human readability before publication."*

A writing-finish workflow for public content. It targets repetitive AI-signature patterns and helps keep tone consistent across READMEs, social posts, and product copy.

**Why it surfaced:** Need for fast quality polish in public-facing writing workflows.
**Shop:** Spells
**Priority:** High

## Recently Shipped

**🎵 Spell — Fanfare**
Completion sound and notification options for long-running tasks.

**🔍 Item — 221B**

## Graduation Criteria

Concepts move from Forge to Armory when they meet all three criteria:

1. **Clear user problem** solved with repeatable value.
2. **Operational reliability** proven in real workflows.
3. **Usable documentation** that supports adoption without insider context.
