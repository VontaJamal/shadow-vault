# Bingo Book — Vault Gate ⛩️

**Status:** Public | [View Repo →](https://github.com/VontaJamal/bingo-book)

Rank every anime you've ever watched. No exceptions. Mt. Rushmore + full grades from F to S. Public profiles, community debates, and zero participation trophies.

## What It Does

Your anime taste, on the record. No hiding.

- **Mt. Rushmore** — Your top 4 anime. Carved in stone. Not debatable. These are your GOATs.
- **Full rankings** — Every anime you've watched gets a grade. F through S. No mercy.
- **Public profiles** — Your Rushmore, your grades, your taste. Own it.
- **Compare** — See how your rankings stack up against others. Find out who has trash taste.
- **Community** — Debate, argue, defend your picks. If Naruto isn't in your Rushmore, explain yourself.

## Where It's Going

- Import from MyAnimeList / AniList
- Shareable profile cards (social media ready)
- "Hot takes" feed — controversial rankings surface to the top
- Seasonal tracking — grade new anime as they air
- Group Rushmores — squad consensus picks

## Open Questions

- Should Mt. Rushmore be permanently locked or allow one swap per year?
- Genre-specific Rushmores (best shonen, best isekai, etc.) or one universal list?
- How to handle anime with multiple seasons — grade each season separately or as one entry?
