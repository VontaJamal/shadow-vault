**Status:** Public | [View Repo →](https://github.com/VontaJamal/dojo)

A 12-week structured training program for multi-agent orchestration. White belt to black belt. The Hyperbolic Time Chamber.

---

## What It Is

Walk in not knowing how to coordinate AI agents. Walk out running autonomous systems. Not theory — you build the thing while you learn the thing.

- **7 belt levels** — White through Black Belt over 12 weeks
- **Week 1-2:** First agent, memory, personality
- **Week 3-4:** File-based persistence, daily logs
- **Week 5-6:** Cron jobs, heartbeats, proactive behavior
- **Week 7-8:** Second agent, agent-to-agent communication
- **Week 9-10:** Orchestration, sub-agents, task routing
- **Week 11-12:** Multi-machine, gateway configs, always-on infrastructure
- **Black Belt:** Your system runs 24/7 without you

## Where It's Going

- Lesson content for each belt level
- Starter templates and scaffolding
- Progress tracking
- Community belt ceremonies (ship your project, earn the belt)

## Open Questions

- Should each belt have a capstone project or continuous building?
- Video walkthroughs vs written guides vs both?
- How to handle different AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) in curriculum?
