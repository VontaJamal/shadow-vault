# Faye — Vault Gate ⛩️

**Status:** Public | [View Repo →](https://github.com/VontaJamal/faye)

The agent framework behind the Shadow Court. 180 files of orchestration infrastructure — memory systems, personality engines, multi-agent coordination, and the architecture that runs autonomous AI agents 24/7.

---

## What It Does

Faye is the Guardian Overseer pattern — one agent orchestrates many. Not a chatbot framework. An operations framework.

- **Memory architecture** — file-based persistence across sessions (daily logs, long-term memory, curated knowledge)
- **Multi-agent coordination** — agent-to-agent messaging, session management, sub-agent spawning
- **Personality system** — SOUL.md defines who the agent IS, not just what it does
- **Cron automation** — heartbeats, scheduled synthesis, proactive behavior
- **Multi-machine** — gateway configs for running agents across multiple devices
- **180 files** — governance, CI, contributing guides, design systems, roadmap

## Where It's Going

- Agent template system — spin up new agents from archetypes
- Skill packaging — portable capability modules
- Voice integration patterns
- Dashboard and monitoring

## Open Questions

- What's the right abstraction level for agent personality? SOUL.md works but is it teachable?
- How should agent memory scale? File-based works at current size but what about 6 months of daily logs?
- Multi-agent coordination patterns — pub/sub vs direct messaging vs orchestrator model?
