# Grimoire — Vault Gate ⛩️

**Status:** Public | [View Repo →](https://github.com/VontaJamal/grimoire)

Open your grimoire. Learn anything. Remember everything. A flashcard system where you control exactly what you study and how you study it.

---

## What It Does

Not another generic flashcard app. Grimoire gives you granular control over your study sessions.

- **Create flashcards** — organize into chapters, sections, or any category you define
- **Granular study sessions** — study Chapter 1 only, Chapters 1 and 3, or everything at once
- **You control the scope** — no algorithm deciding what you should review. You pick.
- **34 files** — working codebase, not a concept

## Where It's Going

- Spaced repetition (optional, not forced)
- Import/export decks
- Collaborative grimoires — share study sets
- Progress tracking and mastery indicators
- Mobile-friendly interface

## Open Questions

- Spaced repetition as default or opt-in? Some people want full control, others want the algorithm.
- Deck sharing — public marketplace or invite-only?
- Should it integrate with the Dojo for agent orchestration study material?
