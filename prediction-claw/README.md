# Prediction Claw Culling Games — Vault Gate ⛩️

**Status:** Public | [View Repo →](https://github.com/VontaJamal/prediction-claw-culling-games)

A monthly anime-inspired trading tournament. 10 contestants enter. Escalating rules. Phase eliminations. One winner remains. Think Hunger Games meets prediction markets.

## What It Does

Monthly seasons where contestants compete through real market predictions on Kalshi.

- **10 → 8 → 6 → 3 → 1** bracket elimination across 4 phases
- **Rising floors** — minimum balance increases each phase (200 → 350 → 550 → 800)
- **Daily events and twists** — no two days play the same
- **Entry fee = prize pool** — DraftKings model, virtual balance on real prices
- **49 files** — full game design, docs, decision records, UI design system
- **Doc-first spec** — built for immediate implementation handoff

## Where It's Going

- Live platform with real Kalshi price feeds
- Spectator mode — watch tournaments unfold in real-time
- Private games — run your own tournament with friends
- Season replays and highlight reels
- Leaderboard and season history

## Open Questions

- Optimal season length — full month or shorter sprints?
- Should eliminated players get a "wildcard" re-entry mechanism?
- Prize split: winner-take-all vs top 3 split?
