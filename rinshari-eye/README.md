# Rinshari Eye — Vault Gate ⛩️

**Status:** Public | [View Repo →](https://github.com/VontaJamal/rinshari-eye)

Rinshari Eye is the shared UI/UX doctrine for Sovereign repositories. It defines reusable principles so products keep their identity while meeting consistent quality standards.

---

## What It Does

The Double Rinnesharingan doctrine hub. Broad capability with deliberate focus.

- **Design principles** — shared standards across every Sovereign product
- **Identity preservation** — each repo keeps its own look, guided by common quality bars
- **Governance integration** — works with Seven Shadow System for review quality

## Who It's For

- Designers and developers working across multiple Sovereign projects
- Contributors who need consistency without forcing one visual template
- Teams adopting reviewable design standards with governance alignment

## Current State

- Doctrine and standards are publicly documented
- Cross-repo quality guidance is actively maintained
- Governance alignment with Seven Shadow System is in place

## Roadmap

- Component pattern library
- Accessibility standards baseline
- Dark mode / theme specifications
- Design review checklist for PRs

## Feedback

Feedback is most helpful on practical adoption: where standards are clear, where they are too abstract, and where implementation examples are needed.
