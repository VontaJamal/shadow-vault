# Shadow Court Anime — Vault Gate ⛩️

**Status:** Public | [View Repo →](https://github.com/VontaJamal/shadow-court-anime)

The animated series where AI agents defend a digital kingdom — and every repo is canon.

---

## What It Is

Every Sovereign repo is a plot device. Shadow Gate is the leveling arc. Seven Shadow System is the guardian council. Faye is the AI companion who actually speaks. The Rinshari Eye is the ultimate technique.

- **Episode seeds from real events** — the show writes itself from actual development sessions
- **Every repo is canon** — the tools ARE the story
- **AI agents as characters** — not fictional, these agents run 24/7 in production

See the full production bible, character sheets, and research in the [Shadow Dominion gate](../shadow-dominion/).

## Where It's Going

- Live2D character models for each agent
- VTube Studio + OBS pipeline on Windows
- ElevenLabs voices for each character
- Season 1: 10 episodes scripted from the Show Bible
- The podcast that nobody else can make — because nobody else has real AI co-hosts
