# Shadow Gate — Vault Gate ⛩️

**Status:** Public | [View Repo →](https://github.com/VontaJamal/shadow-gate)

A gamified productivity engine inspired by Solo Leveling. Daily quests, XP tracking, streak enforcement, and public accountability — because expertise happens in the open or not at all.

---

## What It Does

Cold. Mechanical. Unavoidable. Shadow Gate delivers daily quests at 6 AM and punishes neglect.

- **Daily quests** — auto-generated tasks tied to your active repos and projects
- **XP and leveling** — track progress across projects with ranks and streaks
- **Neglect penalties** — untouched projects lose XP. Consistency is enforced, not suggested.
- **Public output pressure** — randomly tags quests with `[PUBLIC]` to force visible work
- **Weekly escalation** — Sunday deadlines approach and the pressure increases

## Where It's Going

- Quest generation from git activity and repo health
- Integration with the Dojo belt system (quests unlock belt progression)
- Leaderboards for competitive accountability
- Custom quest templates for different project types

## Open Questions

- How punishing should neglect penalties be? Motivating vs discouraging is a fine line.
- Should public output requirements be opt-in or mandatory by default?
- Team mode — can this work for squads, not just solo developers?
