# Shadow Gate — Vault Gate ⛩️

**Status:** Open (Early)

Shadow Gate is the progression layer for measuring consistent shipping activity and development momentum.

## What It Does

- Tracks contribution activity as progression signals
- Surfaces momentum trends and streak-style accountability cues
- Provides a gamified framing for consistent execution habits

## Who It's For

- Developers who want visible momentum tracking in their workflow
- Teams exploring lightweight progression mechanics around delivery
- Builders who prefer accountability signals tied to actual output

## Current State

- The gate is open in early form
- Core progression concepts are documented and being refined
- Public-facing implementation details are still being expanded

## Roadmap

- Publish explicit scoring and progression rules
- Add setup guidance and integration examples
- Define clear data boundaries and interpretation guidance

## Feedback

Feedback is most useful on progression fairness, signal quality, and practical developer usefulness.
